# STA145 Final Project 
This is my replication package for my final project for STA 145. Out of 120 legislators, I decided to take 2 variables such as a legislator's years in office and how many committees they are currently serving on. I decided to choose these specific two because I interned under LD 15's ASW, and I also sat on commitee hearings in the NJ Statehouse this summer, and it raised my curiousness about if these two varibles correlate.

## Data 
To operationalize years in office, I reviewed official legislative biographies and state legislative records to determine the total number of years each legislator had served at the time of data collection. When legislators had non-consecutive terms, I summed the total years served across all periods in office.

I operationalized number of committees by consulting the legislature’s official website and documenting how many standing committees each legislator was assigned to during the current legislative session. Only permanent standing committees were counted, and temporary or ad-hoc committees were excluded to maintain consistency.

The concept of legislative role characteristics was operationalized by examining each legislator’s profile and coding them according to categories that capture common distinctions in state legislative work. Leadership roles include positions such as Speaker, Majority Leader, or Committee Chair. Policy-focused legislators are those whose committee assignments and legislative activity emphasize issue-specific policy work. Constituency-focused legislators are those whose public statements and sponsored bills primarily address local or district-level concerns. Generalist legislators are those who do not fit neatly into the other categories and have a broad or mixed legislative portfolio.
